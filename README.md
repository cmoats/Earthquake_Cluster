# Earthquake_Cluster
This implements the k-means clustering algorithm and plots earthquake data (with magnitudes greater than 6 from 2010 to 2021) on a map. To run, download the files and make sure that the data is in the same file as earthquake_cluster python file.  



# Results

After running the program, I got this:

The size of the dots reflect the different magnitude of each earthquake and the different colors represent the clusters. To check how accurate our plotting looks, we can compare our plot to a map of the tectonic plates of Earth. So, we expect most of our earthquakes to be happening near the tectonic plate borders and if they aren't then we either have wrong data or we did something else wrong. 

Here is a map of the tectonic plates:

So we can see that most of our earthquakes are happening along the tectonic plates which means our plot is working well.
