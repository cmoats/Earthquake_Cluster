# Earthquake_Cluster
This implements the k-means clustering algorithm and plots earthquake data (with magnitudes greater than 6 from 2010 to 2021) on a map online. To run, download the file and make sure that the data is in the same file as earthquake_cluster python file.  



# Results

After running my results I got this:
![image of earthquake cluster](https://github.com/cmoats/Earthquake_Cluster/blob/main/Clustering%20results.PNG)

The size of the dots reflects the different magnitude of each earthquake and the different colors represent the clusters. We can see that a few of our dots are off our image and that's because our image does not get the whole world map and I couldn't a really good image. One question that could then arise is how accurate is our plotting points and to see this we could compare our earthquake visual to a map that shows the location of the tectonic plates.
